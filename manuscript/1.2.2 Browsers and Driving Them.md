## 1.2.2 Browsers and "Driving" Them

We normally use browsers by clicking with our mouse and typing with our keyboard. That works well for humans, but doesn't make sense when trying to write automated tests.

Instead of building some sort of physical robot that can control a mouse and type on a keyboard, we invented software that mimics these actions. Selenium RC was one of the original tools to do this. WebDriver, which was also developed around the same time as Selenium RC, became a popular alternative. In 2009, the two teams combined forces to create Selenium WebDriver.

Over the years, standardization on the Selenium WebDriver commands occurred, and now there is [an official W3C spec for WebDriver](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/). The teams behind the browsers we use have also started to implement that spec (e.g. chromedriver), allowing the use of WebDriver commands outside of Selenium. 

Recently, Chrome has released support for their own protocol called "Chrome DevTools". WebdriverIO has added support for this protocol through [the devtools package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devtools). The industry has evolved its tooling over the years and WebdriverIO has kept up giving you the flexibility to pick what works best.

This is why WebdriverIO has the tagline "Next-gen browser and mobile automation test framework for Node.js," excluding any specific protocol. While you can use Selenium in your WebdriverIO tests, it's really just about running commands through any protocol with support. WebdriverIO doesn't want to box you in to a specific solution, and we appreciate that :)

Now, it's important not to confuse terms, so to be clear, the following list contains many *different* things:

- **WebDriver**: A technical specification defining how tools should work.
- **The Selenium Project**: An organization providing tools used for automated testing.
- **Selenium/Selenium WebDriver**: Language-specific bindings for the WebDriver spec that are officially supported by the Selenium project, like the NPM package [selenium-webdriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver).
- **Browser Driver**: Browser specific implementations of the WebDriver spec (e.g. ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, etc).
- **Selenium Server**: A proxy server used to assist a variety of browser drivers.
- **Chrome Devtools Protocol**: A protocol that allows for tools to instrument, inspect, debug and profile Chromium, Chrome and other Blink-based browsers. ([Project Homepage](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/))
- **Puppeteer** A Node.js library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol.
- **WebdriverIO**: A test framework written in Node.js that provides bindings for tools like Selenium Server, Chrome DevTools (via Puppeteer) and WebDriver-based browser drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver).

That's a fair number of terms to keep in mind. I don't have a great suggestion for how to memorize everything, but maybe just reference this section when you need a good reminder. 

### What Do We Use?

Right now there are essentially two different approaches to how you can automate a browser. One uses the official W3C web standard (i.e., WebDriver) and the other uses native browser interfaces that some of the browsers expose (e.g., Chrome DevTools).

The WebDriver protocol is the de-facto standard automation technique. It allows you to not only automate all desktop browsers, but also run automation on mobile devices, desktop applications or even Smart TVs. This gives us a tremendous amount of power in being able to run our tests across a variety of systems.

On the other side of things, that are many native browser interfaces to run automation on. In the past, every browser had its own (often not documented) protocol. But these days a lot of browsers, including Chrome, Edge and soon Firefox, come with a somewhat unified interface revolving around the Chrome DevTools Protocol.

While WebDriver provides true cross browser support and allows you to run tests on a large scale in the cloud using vendors like Sauce Labs, native browser interfaces often allow many more automation capabilities like listening and interacting with network or DOM events while often being limited to a single browser only. These native interfaces also run much faster than their WebDriver counterparts, as they're a bit "closer to the metal".

We're going to take a minute to look at how to get set up with a few of these solutions. Throughout the book though, our examples with use the WebDriver protocol, since it's the most popular standard in use as of this writing. Thankfully though, it's very easy to switch between protocols in WebdriverIO, so we're not boxing ourselves in by picking one or the other.

### Using the Chrome DevTools Protocol

Starting with Version 6, WebdriverIO now provides support for the Chrome DevTools protocol by default. This means that to run a local test script, you don't need to download a driver or Selenium. When running your test, WebdriverIO will first check if a browser driver is running and available. If not, it falls back to using Puppeteer (assuming you have a Chromium, Chrome or other Blink-based browser installed). Seeing that Chrome is the most popular browser in use as of the writing of this book, chances are you already have it installed. 

To use the Chrome DevTools protocol for your tests, simply ensure you have Chrome (or an equivalent) installed. Everything else is handled by default.

### How To Use a 'Driver'?

If you are interested running your tests for a browser that isn't based on the 'Blink' engine (or just prefer to stick with the WebDriver standard), you'll want to use some sort of WebDriver-based browser driver. There are several WebDriver clients available, Selenium Server being the most popular. Let's walk through setting up one of these clients so that you can start writing tests.

All major browsers have 'drivers' that mostly follow the WebDriver spec (unfortunately there are still differences between them).

Here are the drivers for each major browser:

- [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver) for Firefox (v48 and above)
- [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) for Chromium
- [EdgeDriver](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/) for Microsoft Edge
- [SafariDriver](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/about_webdriver_for_safari) for Safari (implemented as a Safari browser extension)
- [IEDriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver) for Internet Explorer

To see how your favorite browser driver stacks up in regards to WebDriver support, check out [the Web Platform Tests page](https://wpt.fyi/results/webdriver/tests). This site runs regular tests against clients implementing the WebDriver spec, and provides the results showing how well they support it.

There are drivers available for mobile testing (e.g. Appium), but they won't be covered in this book. 

### Installing and Running ChromeDriver

Installation instructions for these clients can be found on their respective websites, but in many cases, you can search on npmjs.org for Node.js-based installation tools. 

For example, you can download and install ChromeDriver using [the NPM ChromeDriver package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromedriver).

To install the NPM package, run 

```sh
npm install -g chromedriver
```

You can then start a ChromeDriver instance by running:

```sh
chromedriver
```

![Terminal Output from manually running ChromeDriver](images/67E0ABF397C9682B162CA5AAEC198DE9.jpg)

This instance will continue to run until you stop it. To do that, issue an 'exit' command by pressing the `ctrl+c` key combo.

#### Installing and Running the Selenium Standalone Server

_First off, if you're going to be using this method, you need to ensure you have a recent version of Java installed on your computer. Be sure to take care of that before trying the following. None of the content of this book requires a Selenium instance, so feel free to skip this section._

If you're looking to run tests on a variety of browsers, you'll probably want to check out what the Selenium Server project does. It offers a 'hub' that allows you to start multiple browser instances and control them all through one single location.

While it is possible to manually download and start [a selenium server](https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/), there is an NPM tool called "[selenium-standalone](https://github.com/vvo/selenium-standalone)" that makes this much easier.

To install and use it, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm i -g selenium-standalone
```

This will make a global command available called `selenium-standalone`. With this command, we can do the following:

1. Install the four supported WebDriver clients (ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver, IEDriver, Microsoft Edge Driver)
2. Start a Selenium Server that acts as a proxy to these clients

To run the install, issue this command:

```sh
selenium-standalone install
```

![Terminal Output from running selenium-standalone 'install' command](images/87316B0AAAF61FBDD512F605AF29747D.jpg)

You should only need to do this once (although you may need to run it again after driver updates occur).

Then, to start your server, run:

```sh
selenium-standalone start
```

![Terminal Output from running selenium-standalone 'start' command](images/1DBF914439371D62317FD2BCFB7E0D23.jpg)

This server will run until it receives an `exit` command (similar to how ChromeDriver works). You can issue that command with the `ctrl+c` key combo.

We'll talk more about using Chrome DevTools, the Selenium Standalone Server and ChromeDriver (including services to integrate them with WebdriverIO) in a little bit.
