# 3.1 A (Temporary) Conclusion

First off, if you've made it to here, a huge thank you for your efforts. I really do appreciate the time you've taken to read what I have to say about WebdriverIO, and to learn the technology behind so many automated test suites out there. I hope the content has been informative, and helped you to evaluate new ways that you can write better tests.

This serves as the temporary ending to this book. While there is more content I'd love to cover (e.g., visual regression testing), I'm going to put that on hold so I can focus on fine-tuning what I've written so far. In the same way that you shouldn't write new tests if the ones you currently have aren't working, you shouldn't write new content until the content you've already written is all correct.

On that note, I welcome any and all feedback on this book. You can reach out through [the contact form on my website](https://blog.kevinlamping.com/contact-me/), send a private note via [the Leanpub contact form](https://leanpub.com/webapp-testing-guidebook/email_author/new), or email me at kevin@learnwebdriverio.com. I really hope to hear from you (even just to say hi!)

Finally, a huge thanks to the entire WebdriverIO community, but especially the maintainers and project committers who make WebdriverIO possible. Your contributions are used around the world by the community to make websites better, and I can't thank you enough.

Also, I want to give a special thanks to Michael Gilbert for his tireless efforts in editing this book. He has found countless typos and grammar mistakes and this book is much better because of it. Thanks!

I will continue updating this book, including finishing all the TODO items I've left for myself. Eventually this conclusion chapter will be removed and replaced with a real conclusion. Until then, have fun testing!
