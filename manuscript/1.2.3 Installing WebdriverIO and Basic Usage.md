## 1.2.3 Installing WebdriverIO and Basic Usage

The time has finally come! We've laid all the groundwork to understand the nuts and bolts behind UI testing. Now it's time to do some!

To start off, we're going to create a new folder for our first example. In a directory of your choice, make a new folder called `wdio-standalone`:

```sh
mkdir wdio-standalone
```

Why `wdio-standalone`?

Well, WebdriverIO allows you to use it through two modes. The first, which we're going through here, is called "standalone" mode. It's meant as a simple way to use WebdriverIO, and allows you to build wrappers around the tool. 

"Testrunner" mode, which we'll cover in the next section, is a bit more complicated. It provides an entire set of tools and hooks for full-fledged integration testing. I mentioned that standalone mode allows you to build wrappers around it. Well, the testrunner is essentially that.

Right now, just to introduce you to WebdriverIO, we're going to use the standalone runner. This is only for this exercise though, and we'll be upgrading to the testrunner soon.

With all that said, let's 'move' our terminal into this `wdio-standalone` folder:

```sh
cd wdio-standalone
```

(For Windows, it's the same command for both actions)

Inside our new folder, we're going to initialize it as an NPM project. This will allow us to save the project dependencies that we'll be installing through NPM.

To do that, run:

```sh
npm init -y
```

The `-y` will answer 'yes' to all the prompts, giving us a standard NPM project. Feel free to omit the `-y` if you'd like to specify your project details.

With that out of the way, let's install WebdriverIO:

```sh
npm install webdriverio
```

Now is a good time to mention that WebdriverIO is split into multiple NPM packages. We'll be looking at those packages in detail later on, but note that installing `webdriverio` via the command above does not give you everything.

What it does give us is a Node.js module that we can use inside of a Node.js file. Let's use that.

First, we'll create a new file called 'test.js`:

```sh
touch test.js
```
 
On Windows, that command is:

```text
type nul > test.js
```

Now we have a file to add our first test to. Go ahead and open that file up in the text editor of your choice.

Next, we'll copy the example given on the official WebdriverIO website. Throw the following code into your `test.js` file and save it:

{title="test.js"}
```js
const { remote } = require('webdriverio');

(async () => {
    const browser = await remote({
        capabilities: {
            browserName: 'chrome'
        }
    });

    await browser.url('https://webdriver.io');

    const title = await browser.getTitle();
    console.log('Title was: ' + title);

    await browser.deleteSession();
})().catch((e) => console.error(e));
```

Here's a quick overview of the file:

1. We load the `remote` object from the WebdriverIO package.
2. We wrap our code in an `async` function so we can use `await` statements.
3. We create a new session using `remote`, saving the reference to a `browser` object which we use to send commands.
4. We send a `url` command, requesting the browser go to the WebdriverIO website.
5. We then get the title of the page, storing it as a local variable.
6. The title of the page is logged to the terminal.
7. The session is ended, since we're done with our test.
8. A simple catch statement is added in case anything goes wrong.

Okay, that's what it does; let's run it to see it in action.

To do that, we need to have a browser available to running. This can be through the built-in support from a Chrome install, through a specific browser driver, or through Selenium server. 

In "Browsers and 'Driving' Them", I detailed Chrome DevTools, along with how to install and run ChromeDriver and the selenium-standalone NPM package. Now let's put that knowledge to use.

### Running Through Chrome DevTools

So long as you have Chrome (or a Blink-based browser installed), there's really nothing you need to do here for installation/start-up. All you need to do is run your test file through the node CLI. We do that by telling Node.js to execute our test file. That command looks like:

```sh
node test.js
```

After a second, you should see a Chrome browser pop-up for a moment, and some similar output in your terminal:

```sh
2020-07-24T21:03:30.968Z INFO webdriverio: Initiate new session using the

```

Congrats, you've just run your first WebdriverIO test!

Notice that the first line says "Initiate new session using the devtools protocol". That will change depending on which protocol you use. 

If you choose to go with the DevTools protocol, support for the various commands does differ from WebDriver. While in general everything is supported the same, there are still differences which can cause hiccups along the way. The book is written with support for the WebDriver protocol, so if you choose to stick with the DevTools protocol, expect some differences.

Now let's look at running via ChromeDriver.
    
### Running in ChromeDriver

The basic idea is the same, although we do need to tweak our settings just a little bit.

This is a little technical, but by default, a ChromeDriver server uses port `9515` to listens for commands (e.g., http://localhost:9515)

But by default, WebdriverIO expects the WebDriver server to be running on port `4444`.

So, we can either override the WebdriverIO defaults, or tell our ChromeDriver server to use port `4444`.

It's most useful to see how to overwrite the WebdriverIO defaults, so let's do that next. If you are interested, you can do the latter by running `chromedriver --port=4444` when starting the ChromeDriver server.

Back in your `test.js` file, take a look at lines 4-8:

```js
const browser = await remote({
    capabilities: {
        browserName: 'chrome'
    }
});
```

What we're doing here is creating a new `remote` WebDriver session and telling it that we want to open up the 'chrome' browser. We'll get into capabilities at a later point, so don't worry too much about it right now.

What we will worry about is how to customize that 'remote' session to use post 9515 instead of the default 4444.

Along with customizing the `capabilities`, there are a number of other options available to us. [The official documentation](https://webdriver.io/docs/options.html#webdriver-options) gives the entire list, but there are three options that we're going to change:

**hostname**
Host of your driver server.
Type: String
Default: localhost

**port**
Port your driver server is on.
Type: Number
Default: 4444

**path**
Path to driver server endpoint.
Type: String
Default: /wd/hub

We're only going to be looking at the `port` option right now, but I wanted to mention all three as they're related and important to know about (which we'll see when we get to the Selenium Standalone instructions.)

So to use a custom port, we pass it in as an option to the `remote` function:

```js
const browser = await remote({
    port: 9515,
    capabilities: {
        browserName: 'chrome'
    }
});
```

Note that it's a number, not a string (i.e., `9515` versus `'9515'`). If you try using a string, you will get an error of `Error: Expected option "port" to be type of number but was string`. 

If you still have your ChromeDriver instance running from before, leave it up and running (you can check http://localhost:9515/ to see if it gives you a response). If not, start an instance in a separate terminal window. 

With our WebdriverIO settings updated and ChromeDriver ready to go, we can call our test script again.

Run `node test.js` one more time and validate that it all works as expected. The output should be similar to before:

```sh

http://localhost:9515/session/8c1bfcbb0617b87676343fe9c658fc93
```

While there are a few differences from before, the important one is the first line. See how it says it's using the WebDriver protocol? That's how we can know things are working as we want. 

### Running Through Selenium Standalone

_Note: Selenium Standalone is **not** the same thing as WebdriverIO Standalone mode. They simply share the same name to describe their "independent" nature._

If you already have your Selenium server running from before, great! If not, open up a new terminal window and run `selenium-standalone start`. 

Aside from seeing the server running in your terminal, you can check that you have a Selenium instance up and running by visiting the following url in your browser: [http://localhost:4444/wd/hub](http://localhost:4444/wd/hub)

You should see a website looking a lot like this:

![Preview of Selenium Standalone 'hub' page](images/36DFFD8164ACC4192A2D97CB974C62FC.jpg)

Note: If you get a 404 error, something went wrong while starting your server, and you'll need to resolve it before proceeding.

The next thing we need to do is configure WebdriverIO to use the Selenium server. 

Unlike ChromeDriver, when you start Selenium, it runs on port `4444` by default. That means we can comment out or remove the `port` option we had for our ChromeDriver usage.

That said, Selenium waits for requests to come through the `/wd/hub` URL endpoint/path (hence `http://localhost:4444/wd/hub` being mentioned before). But if you recall from our options, WebdriverIO doesn't have that at it's default `path` option (which is just `/`).

To use Selenium, we'll need to update that path setting to match where Selenium defaults to:

```js
const browser = await remote({
    path: '/wd/hub',
    capabilities: {
        browserName: 'chrome'
    }
});
```

Running our test once more with `node test.js`, you should see similar output:

```sh
2020-07-18T15:33:51.348Z INFO webdriverio: Initiate new session using the webdri
ver protocol

2020-07-18T15:33:57.275Z INFO webdriver: COMMAND getTitle()
2020-07-18T15:33:57.275Z INFO webdriver: [GET] http://localhost:4444/wd/hub/sess

 http://localhost:4444/wd/hub/session/8e71129f6b0b4cb3cd09bd17b06bd6ca
```

Again, line one shows that we're using the WebDriver protocol. And notice on line two that it posts to `http://localhost:4444/wd/hub/session`, using the path we provided.

If you instead of all that output you see an error that includes `RequestError: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:4444`, this means your Selenium server wasn't running. Start it back up and try again. 

### Leaving It at That

This will be the end of our little test file. We're not going to be updating it anymore, and will in fact be leaving this whole `wdio-standalone` folder behind.

Why? Because we're moving on to a much better way of using WebdriverIO through its test runner. That's coming up next.
