# 2.1 Site Loading and Navigation

## 2.1.1 Avoiding Troubles

I want to jump right in to setting up our WebdriverIO configuration, but first, a warning.

One of the biggest traps I see newcomers face is their ambition. They start off over-optimistic, and use as many tools as they can get their hands on. It's easy (and kind of fun) to come up with a list of features you want your test framework to have. These tools may look easy-to-use on the outside, but getting them all to work together is a very different story. 

It's not that they can't work together; they get along just fine most of the time. But when starting out, any mistake made along the way (or difference in setup), can cause errors that are difficult to understand.

Take the following error I've run into before:

`TypeError: Cannot read property 'trim' of undefined`

That's not very helpful. Here, have a hint:

```sh
(node:2155) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection (rejection
 id: 1): channel closed
(node:2155) [DEP0018] DeprecationWarning: Unhandled promise rejections are deprecate
d. In the future, promise rejections that are not handled will terminate the Node.js
 process with a non-zero exit code.
```

So, is that caused by WebdriverIO, the Selenium-Standalone server, CucumberJS or the Allure reporter?

Maybe some more error output will help?

```sh
/webdriverio/build/lib/utils/BaseReporter.js:336
    throw _iteratorError;
    ^

TypeError: Cannot read property 'trim' of undefined
    at getTestStatus (/node_modules/wdio-allure-reporter/build/reporter.js:68:41)
```

Ah, it must be the Allure reporter, right?

Well, despite Allure throwing the error, it has nothing to do with the reporter. Instead, it's caused by having a CucumberJS step definition with an incorrect number of parameters in the callback function.

Now, if you're unfamiliar with Allure or Cucumber, that may not make sense, but worry not (I'm certain you were concerned). My point isn't to narrow down on a specific error, but to show an example of how introducing extra features too early can really slow you down. I have a fair amount of experience with these two tools and this bug still took me a while to figure out.

I'll state this one last time just for dramatic emphasis: The biggest roadblock newcomers face is not in the fundamentals, but trying to do too much at once. 

So we're going to start out simple and introduce new tools and concepts one-by-one. We'll build up until we have a full-featured framework ready to tackle any situation. As errors arise, we'll have fewer dark alleys to look down, making it easier to identify what's going wrong and get back to doing things right.

I'll also be introducing some concepts that won't be sticking around. They'll just be stepping stones to help you get across the scary swamp of some terrible thing that starts with an S (I don't know, it's just for alliteration purposes).

For example, in our first exercise, we'll be talking about assertions. In it, I'll show three different ways to achieve the same effect. We'll only stick with one of them though. I'll explain throughout the process the downfalls of the other options and why I chose my recommended one.

I believe it's really important to know what options you have, how some of them build upon others, and why you'd choose one over the other. Expect to see a fair amount of this throughout the book!

## 2.1.2 Let's Start

We've already covered installation and basic test writing, but we're going to go over it again. Hopefully a bit quicker this time.

The first step we'll take is to create a new folder to store our up-and-coming tests. **This should not be inside the same folder you used for the 'testrunner' exercise**. So, create a new folder outside of that. You can call it `wdio-realworld` just for fun.

In there, do the usual NPM setup:

```sh
npm init -y
npm install @wdio/cli
```

Next, let's get that config setup through the WDIO CLI:

```sh
npx wdio
```

Our answers will be:

```sh
=========================
WDIO Configuration Helper
=========================

? Where is your automation backend located? On my local machine
? Which framework do you want to use? mocha
? Do you want to run WebdriverIO commands synchronous or asynchronous? sync
? Where are your test specs located? ./test/specs/**/*.js
? Do you want WebdriverIO to autogenerate some test files? No
? Are you using a compiler? No!
? Which reporter do you want to use? spec
? Do you want to add a service to your test setup? chromedriver
? What is the base url? http://localhost:8080/
```

Almost all of the above answers are defaults, except for a few:

- We'll use the `chromedriver` service. Feel free to use `selenium-standalone` if you prefer (or neither).
- For the base url, we use the local server you set up in the previous chapter `http://localhost:8080/`. You're welcome to use the book's demo site here if you'd prefer ([https://demo.learnwebdriverio.com](https://demo.learnwebdriverio.com)), but do note it may cause problems in later chapters.

Okay, now that we have our config ready, it's time to create our test directory. Since we went with the default path, we need to create two directories, `test` and a subdirectory called `specs`. You can do that how you like, but here's how I do it:

In a bash shell (Linux/Mac): `mkdir -p test/specs`
In a Windows shell: `mkdir test\specs`

Finally, create a new file inside the specs directory (you can call it `navigation.js`) and open it in your preferred text editor.

In a bash shell (Linux/Mac): `touch test/specs/navigation.js`
In a Windows shell: `echo.>test\specs\navigation.js`

## 2.1.3 Writing our First Real Test

In our file, we'll start things off by writing the `describe` block needed for Mocha to understand we're defining a new test:

```js
describe('Homepage', function () { });
```

We call `describe` like a function, passing in two parameters. The first is a name for the feature we are testing. I put that we're testing the 'Homepage'. This name will be used in our test reporting, which you'll see in a moment.

The second half of our `describe` call is a function which contains all of the code we want to associate with this feature.

Inside this function we'll be adding the `it` call. Similar to `describe`, `it` is a function call that takes two parameters, the first is the name of the specific test (we'll say it 'should take you to the login page'), and the second is a function which contains our actual test code. The full `it` call looks like this:

```js
it('should load properly', function () { });
```

Just to recap and refresh on the Mocha syntax:

- `describe` is used to group sets of tests by the feature they are testing.
- `it` defines a specific test to run.

And remember, `it` always goes inside `describe`. Here's what the whole thing looks like:

```js
describe('Homepage', function () {
  it('should load properly', function () {
    // test code will go here
  });
});
```

Okay, now that we have our test structure in place, it's time to add our commands. Let's start by loading the main page of the site. You can find a full list of commands on the WebdriverIO site in [their API docs](https://webdriver.io/docs/api.html).

The command we'll use is [`browser.url`](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/browser/url.html). This command tells the browser to open a URL (bet you didn't guess that). It does have a trick up its sleeve though.

Remember that `baseUrl` setting we provided? I mentioned this before, but in case you didn't catch it, `browser.url` will prepend that `baseUrl` value if you define a relative path. 

For example, if I say `browser.url('./tag/wdio')`, it will load the full URL of `http://localhost:8080/tag/wdio`.

Here are some more complex examples, assuming the `baseUrl` is set to `http://example.com/one/`:

```js
browser.url('./two'); // goes to 'http://example.com/one/two'
browser.url('/two');  // goes to 'http://example.com/two'
browser.url('http://anotherexample.com/one'); // goes to 'http://anotherexample.com/one'
```

Essentially, the `./` at the beginning of the value is used to say "keep the entire `baseUrl`." Alternatively, using just `/` at the start means that it will use only the domain of the URL, stripping off any subfolders.

Finally, you can have it ignore the `baseUrl` by passing your own domain.

All right, let's use a simple `browser.url('./')` in our test to load up the homepage of the site:

```js
describe('Homepage', function () {
    it('should load properly', function () {
        // load the page
        browser.url('./');
    });
});
```

To ensure the page has loaded, we're going to log out the title of the page we're on using [the `browser.getTitle()` command](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/webdriver.html#gettitle). Can you guess what that does?

Yes, it gets the title of the page.

In our case, the title is `Conduit`, so we should see that logged out when running our test:

```js
describe('Main Navigation', function () {
    it('should take you to the login page', function () {
        // Load the page
        browser.url('./');
        
        // Get the title of the homepage, should be 'Conduit'
        console.log(browser.getTitle());
    });
});
```

Pretty exciting, I know.

## 2.1.4 Elements and Actions

Now let's try clicking something, like the `Sign In` link.

To do that, we're going to use [the `click` command](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/element/click.html), but it won't be `browser.click()` which would throw an error in your face.

No, in order to click an element, you need to let WebdriverIO know which element to click.

If you've used jQuery, which was a very popular JavaScript library from 2006 to 2016-or-so, you'd be familiar with the `$` function. If not, what it does is pick an element out of the HTML based on a "Selector." Selectors are like getting someone's attention by calling their name. 

Some selectors can be very specific, like getting the attention of someone named `Thisisaveryuniquenamethatnooneelsehasihope`. Some are more general and might get multiple results, like yelling "John" at the store (apologies to the Johns out there and the store manager for yelling in her store). We'll get into selectors more in a little bit, but know that they come in all shapes and sizes.

So WebdriverIO has mimicked the functionality of jQuery and provides [its own `$` function](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/element/$.html). We're going to pretend you know what I mean and use a partial text based selector (we'll talk more about selectors soon).

What element are we getting? Well, we want to click the "Sign In" link at the top of the page. Here's what that HTML looks like:

```html
<ul data-qa-id="site-nav" class="nav navbar-nav pull-xs-right">
    <li class="nav-item">
        <a href="/" class="nav-link">
            Home
        </a>
    </li>
    <li class="nav-item">
        <a href="/login" class="nav-link">
            <i class="ion-compose"></i>
            Sign in
        </a>
    </li>
    <li class="nav-item">
        <a href="/register" class="nav-link">
            <i class="ion-compose"></i>
            Sign up
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>
```

There are a couple of ways we can specify the 'Sign In' link, but let's go with the simplest. We're going to request an `a` element on the page that has text containing `Sign In`. We could add more to this selector, like the link needs a class name of `nav-link`, but this is good enough for now. As I mentioned, we'll cover this more soon. 

To say we want a link that has specific text in it, we write our selector like this: `$('=the text to search by')`. For our needs, we're going to do `$('=Sign In')`. 

By using that `$` function with our selector, we now have an element that we can call the `click` command on:

```js
// Click the 'Sign In' navigation link
$('=Sign In').click();
```

This triggers a mouse click on that element, which the website will take action on and route us to the 'Sign In' page. How can we know though? 

## 2.1.5 Finishing up

Well, we could log out the title of the page again, but there's a problem: The developers of the website didn't code in a title change. As with many things in testing, we need an alternate form of validation.

Let's use [the `getUrl` command](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/webdriver.html#geturl) instead. I'll let you guess what this command does. 

```js        
// Get the URL of the sign in page. It should include 'login'
console.log(browser.getUrl());
```

That's the end of the test. Here's what the whole file looks like:

{title="test/specs/navigation.js"}
```js
describe('Homepage', function () {
    it('should load properly', function () {
        // load the page
        browser.url('./');

        // Get the title of the homepage, should be 'Conduit'
        console.log(browser.getTitle());

        // Click the 'Sign in' navigation link
        $('=Sign in').click();

        // Get the URL of the sign in page. It should include 'login'
        console.log(browser.getUrl());
    });
});
```

Make sure it's saved because it's now time to run it. Back on the command line, start your test by entering `npx wdio`. This will kick off the test runner, opening up a Chrome browser.

The test should take about half a minute to complete. Once finished, you'll see log output that looks very similar to this:

```sh
/webdriverio/build/lib/utils/BaseReporter.js:336
    throw _iteratorError;
    ^

In the middle of all that output are two lines with the content we need. Let's hide all of those extra messages so we get just those two `console.log`'s we used by passing in the `logLevel` setting: `npx wdio --logLevel=silent`. Now our log output will be a lot shorter:

As you see, the page title and URL are logged out. Looks like the site functions as hoped and our test passes!

## 2.1.6 Adding Assertions

So far, we validated that our test successfully ran by checking the log output after execution. This is simple enough to do while we only have a test or two, but it quickly becomes tedious as more and more tests are added.

Instead of us manually checking the values, what if we could tell the computer what to expect and have it check for us? This is what assertions do. They check a value and "assert" that it's a certain way (e.g., it equals another value, it doesn't equal another value, it matches part of another value). If the value isn't what's expected, an error is thrown and the test is marked as failing.

Mocha watches for these assertion errors and catches them during the tests, marking the test as failed if one occurs.

We can update our test to "throw" an error if the values we're looking for aren't correct.

Let's take that first log message. Replacing it, we want to assert that the title is `Conduit`. A simple `if` statement will do the trick:

```js
if (browser.getTitle() !== 'Conduit') {
    // throw an error explaining what went wrong
    throw new Error('Title of the homepage should be "Conduit"');
}
```

Now if the title isn't what we're looking for, it'll jump into the if statement and we can do our dirty work throwing an error. In JavaScript, we do that by saying `throw new Error('My error message')`. You can see the custom error message I include in the previous example.

Let's make the update for our `getUrl` call as well:

```js
if (browser.getUrl() !== 'http://localhost:8080/login') {
    throw new Error('URL of "login" page should be correct');
}
```

Here's the entirety of our updated test:

```js
describe('Homepage', function () {
    it('should load properly', function () {
        // load the page
        browser.url('./');

        // Get the title of the homepage, should be 'Conduit'
        if (browser.getTitle() !== 'Conduit') {
            // throw an error explaining what went wrong
            throw new Error('Title of the homepage should be "Conduit"');
        }

        // Click the 'Sign in' navigation link
        $('=Sign in').click();

        // Get the URL of the sign in page. It should include 'login'
        if (browser.getUrl() !== 'http://localhost:8080/login') {
            throw new Error('URL of "login" page should be correct');
        }
    });
});
```

If we were to run our tests again, the only difference we'd see is that it no longer logs out those two messages (assuming the site didn't break in the time between our test runs). So how do we know our `if` conditions work? Well, say we changed one of the `if` conditions to no longer match the site values (e.g., `if (browser.getTitle() !== 'The wrong title') {` and ran the test again, you'd see the following message:

```sh
[0-0] RUNNING in chrome - /test/specs/navigation.js
[0-0] Error in "Homepage should load properly"

Now our test fails because it didn't get what it was expecting. We no longer need to check the log messages, having added a little more automation in our tests.

## 2.1.7 Expanding Assertions

In the real world, you'll rarely see errors thrown like this. Instead, developers use "Assertion Libraries". These libraries make writing assertions and throwing errors a lot simpler. Let's spend the rest of the chapter looking at a few options.

The first Assertion Library we'll look at comes built in to the Node.js ecosystem. The [NodeJS Assert API](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html#assert_assert) is a standard library in Node.js, and we can use it without any extra installations.

At the top of our test file, add the following line to load this API:

```js
const assert = require('assert');
```

Pay attention that this statement is outside the `describe` block. If we were to include it inside the `describe` block, it would only be available in that section. Any other `describe` blocks would also have to include the statement. That's because variables declared inside the function block are scoped to that function. This is normal JavaScript behavior and is something to watch out for when writing tests.

Next, we need to replace our `if` statement and thrown error with a call to the assert library. There are many ways to assert a value:

```js
const myValue = 'a';

assert(myValue); // You can check that it's a 'truthy' value
assert.strictEqual(myValue, 'a'); // You can check that it's equal to something
assert.notStrictEqual(myValue, 'b'); // You can check that it doesn't equal something
```

We want to validate that the page title is a specific string of text. To do this, we use `assert.strictEqual` and pass in the actual value and then the expected value. The actual value is the result of the `getTitle` call and the expected value is a simple string of text containing our page title.

```js
assert.strictEqual(browser.getTitle(), 'Conduit');
```

Now if our test fails, it will look like:

```sh
[0-0] RUNNING in chrome - /test/specs/navigation.js
[0-0] AssertionError in "Homepage should load properly"
Expected values to be strictly equal:
+ actual - expected

+ 'Conduit'
- 'The Wrong Title'
[0-0] FAILED in chrome - /test/specs/navigation.js

```

Not only is the assertion a little less code to write, it's actually a more helpful message in that it provides the expected and actual values. Assuming we've updated our second check as well, here's what our test now looks like:

```js
const assert = require('assert');

describe('Homepage', function () {
    it('should load properly', function () {
        // load the page
        browser.url('./');

        // Get the title of the homepage, should be 'Conduit'
        assert.strictEqual(browser.getTitle(), 'Conduit');

        // Click the 'Sign in' navigation link
        $('=Sign in').click();

        // Get the URL of the sign in page. It should include 'login'
        assert.strictEqual(browser.getUrl(), 'http://localhost:8080/login');
    });
});
```

## 2.1.8 The WebdriverIO Expect Library

One of the valuable additions of the Version 6 upgrade includes the bundling of ["WebdriverIO Expect" assertions](https://webdriver.io/docs/assertion.html). This library makes writing assertions cleaner by adding support for WebdriverIO syntax.

It's similar to how Node's `assert` library works, but the syntax is a bit different. For example, take the assertions we just looked at:

```js
assert.strictEqual(browser.getTitle(), 'Conduit');
assert.strictEqual(browser.getUrl(), 'http://localhost:8080/login');
```

With the `expect-webdriverio` library, they can be changed to:

```js
expect(browser).toHaveTitle('Conduit');
expect(browser).toHaveUrl('http://localhost:8080/login');
```

Can you tell why I like this format? To me, it's more sentence-like compared to the assert code: We expect the `browser` to have a title of 'Conduit'. I like when my tests read more like specifications and less like code.

We also don't need to load any libaries, as it's included in the base WebdriverIO installation. Here's what the updated test file looks like:

```js
describe('Homepage', function () {
    it('should load properly', function () {
        // load the page
        browser.url('./');

        // Get the title of the homepage, should be 'Conduit'
        expect(browser).toHaveTitle('Conduit');

        // Click the 'Sign in' navigation link
        $('=Sign in').click();

        // Get the URL of the sign in page. It should include 'login'
        expect(browser).toHaveUrl('http://localhost:8080/login');
    });
});
```

And while functionally it's much the same, there are a few features that are worth noting:

- It's easier to write (in my opinion, you're welcome to disagree)
- You get better error messages
- It automatically retries failed assertions

By "better error messages", let's compare the "failure" output if our title was incorrect:

Using `assert.strictEqual(browser.getTitle(), 'Conduit')`:

```sh
[chrome 83.0.4103.106 mac os x #0-0] Input A expected to strictly equal input B:
+ expected - actual

- 'The Wrong Title'
+ 'Conduit'
```

It's helpful, but let's see what it looks like with `expect(browser).toHaveTitle('Conduit')`:

```sh
[chrome 83.0.4103.106 mac os x #0-0] Expect window to have title
Expected: "Conduit"
Received: "Incorrect Page Title"
[chrome 83.0.4103.106 mac os x #0-0] Error: Expect window to have title
[chrome 83.0.4103.106 mac os x #0-0]
[chrome 83.0.4103.106 mac os x #0-0] Expected: "Conduit"
[chrome 83.0.4103.106 mac os x #0-0] Received: "The Wrong Title"
[chrome 83.0.4103.106 mac os x #0-0]     at Context.<anonymous> (/Users/klamping/Sites/temp/wdio-v6/test/specs/home.js:5:25)
```

Now our message provides not just what the two conflicting values are, but where they came from (the window title). Small improvements like this can really help speed along debugging efforts, as you're able to more quickly understand what is failing. You don't have to look through the code to understand that it's the page title that's wrong.

I also mentioned that the 'expect' functionality adds "automatic retries". It will automatically retry the assertion multiple times (assuming it's failing), which helps if the page isn't quite ready for the test yet. While this likely won't be helpful for checking the page title, it can be very valuable for asserting that page elements exist (or don't).

Having elements appear and disappear is an essential part of today's Web Apps, but that can definitely make testing more difficult, as you need to account for this. We'll get into this more later on, but here's a quick example. With an assertion like `expect($('#someElem')).toExist()`, WebdriverIO will try multiple times checking for that element to exist, (in case your assertion ran a second or two too early). This can really help simplify the code you need to write, as the waiting is now implicit (although it can be configured to not retry if you'd like).

## 2.1.9 Exceeding Expectations

Our new assertions are pretty nice, especially since we didn't have to install anything, but we have an issue with them.

Looking at the second assertion, it's limited in its flexibility. In it, we validated the entire URL. But what if we want to test a different instance of the same site? Our assertion would fail even though the navigation to the Login page still worked (because the top-level domain is different, even though the `/login` part of the URL was correct).

We want the test to pass no matter the domain name (since we could be testing this same site on any number of different domains). Right now, with our `toHaveUrl` assertion, it will only pass if we're testing the `http://localhost:8080` site.

Thankfully, there are options. Literally. [The `expect-webdriverio` additions comes with many options](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/expect.html#matcher-options) to customize our assertions. 

For our needs, we can pass a `containing` boolean to tell it to "expect actual value to contain expected value". All options are passed in as an object after our expected value. For our URL check, that will be: `expect(browser).toHaveUrl('/login', { containing: true });`. Notice that we don't have to define every option available, only those we want to customize. 
There are several other options avialable that you'll want to be aware of. Again, check out [the documention](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/expect.html#matcher-options) for more information.

Here's the fully updated file:

```js
describe('Homepage', function () {
    it('should load properly', function () {
        // load the page
        browser.url('./');

        // Get the title of the homepage, should be 'Conduit'
        expect(browser).toHaveTitle('Conduit');

        // Click the 'Sign in' navigation link
        $('=Sign in').click();

        // Get the URL of the sign in page. It should include 'login'
        expect(browser).toHaveUrl('/login', { containing: true });
    });
});
```

With our test updated, save the file and give it another run. Assuming no errors, the output should look the same. If I fail one of the assertions, however, you may see something like:

```sh
[0-0] RUNNING in chrome - /test/specs/navigation.js
[0-0] Error in "Homepage should load properly"
Expect window to have url containing

Expected: "/other-login"
Received: "http://localhost:8080/login"

Spec Files:  0 passed, 1 failed, 1 total (100% completed) in 00:00:14
```

One final note for now on this. Aside from the WebdriverIO specific assertions `expect-webdriverio` adds, you also gain access to the [built-in ExpectJS assertions](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect). Some example assertions are:

```js
expect(browser.getUrl()).toEqual('https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect'); 
// compared to
expect(browser).toHaveUrl('https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect'); 

// Check that there are exactly five links on the page
const links = $$('a');
expect(links).toHaveLength(5);
```

We also can use the `.not` switch to flip our assertion:

```js
expect(browser).not.toHaveUrl('https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect'); 

// Check that there are not exactly five links on the page
const links = $$('a');
expect(links).not.toHaveLength(5);
```

We'll take a look at using more of these as we move forward.

But that finishes off our first test, providing us with the foundation to move towards more complex checks down the road. Assertions are going to be essential in our automation, so taking the time to understand how they work is well worth it.

Next up, we'll look in-depth at a plethora of element selectors, along with how we can wait for content to load and do other funny things.

## 2.1.10 Chapter Challenge

Over the following chapters, I'll include a "Chapter Challenge" at the end of each of them. This is a challenge for you to tackle on your own if you're interested. Brief explanations and my recommended answer (but not necessarily the only answer) are in Chapter 3.0 near the end of this book.

For your first challenge, in your existing test, add a check that validates that when you click on the "Conduit" logo in the top left of the site, it returns you to the homepage.
