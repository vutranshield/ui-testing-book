## 1.1.3 Technical Details

### Versions

Because technology changes fast, it's good to cover what versions of software I used when creating these exercises.

%% [TODO update with latest versions upon book completion]

- Node.js: v12.16.1
- WebdriverIO: 6.3.5
- Java 8 (optional)

### Git Repository

To download code samples for the main part of the book, visit [the official git repo](https://github.com/klamping/wdio-book-examples).

### Where to check for updates/corrections

I've written the book using the most recent version of these technologies as I could. However, with an ever changing landscape, updates will need to be made. 

You can see a list of changes by visiting [the book's changelog](https://github.com/klamping/ui-testing-book/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). 

### Where to find help

I've done my best to make the material clear and understandable, but I'm sure to have fallen short in some areas. To get extra help, try one of these three options:

* [This Book's GitHub Issues Page](https://github.com/klamping/ui-testing-book/issues)
* **Gitter** - WebdriverIO runs an official chat room for folks seeking help with the tool itself. 
* **My personal email** - Although I'm usually slow to respond, you can reach out to me at kevin at learnwebdriverio dot com. I'll do my best to get back to you in a timely manner. 

### Errata

I've worked to ensure that the content of this book is accurate and that the examples actally run. However, I definitely can make mistakes (that's why I'm a fan of testing after all). Also, technology changes, and what worked when I wrote this doesn't necessarily work anymore.

If you find errata, please submit an issue on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/klamping/ui-testing-book/issues) and I'll work to get the error resolved.

### Technical Knowledge Requirements

What sort of skill level do you need in order to understand the material covered in this book?

While I've worked to explain the many concepts introduced through UI testing, I do make the assumption that readers are familiar with the following technologies:

- HTML (basic understanding of how HTML structure is composed)
- CSS (basic understanding of how CSS selectors work)
- JavaScript
- NodeJS
- Terminal/Shell commands

In regards to JavaScript and NodeJS, here are some important concepts to understand:

- Data types: strings, objects, arrays...
- Functions: how to call and create them
- Conditionals: if/else, ternary
- ES6 updates:
  - const & let
  - Array functions: map, forEach
  - Classes (we will cover this in more detail in the page objects section)
  
That said, you don't need to know how to create a Node.js server, build a website or use the latest JavaScript framework.
