## 1.2.6 Running the Example Test Runner Test

Now that we've created and reviewed our configuration file, it's time to write a test to make use of it. 

Since this is the first time we're creating a test, we need to create our folders for the test files to go into.

During setup, we defined out specs path as `./test/specs/\*\*/\*.js`. But we don't have a test folder, nor a specs folder inside it.

Let's create those folders by running the following command from our `wdio-testrunner` project path:

```sh
mkdir -p test/specs
```

On Windows that's:

```text
mkdir test\specs
```

That will create both folders for us. Now we can create our first test file:

```sh
touch ./test/specs/example.js
```

On Windows, `touch` will not work, so you can instead go to the `test/specs/` folder and create a JavaScript file named 'example.js'

Open that file in a text editor and paste in the example from the official WebdriverIO website:

{title="test/specs/example.js"}
```js
describe('webdriver.io page', () => {
    it('should have the right title', () => {
        browser.url('https://webdriver.io');
        expect(browser).toHaveTitle(
            'WebdriverIO · Next-gen browser and mobile automation test \
framework for Node.js'
        );
    });
});
```

There is one thing we want to change. Where it sets the `url`, we instead want to use the `baseUrl` we defined in our configuration file.

So change `browser.url('https://webdriver.io');` to be `browser.url('./');`. When WebdriverIO runs that command, it will see that it isn't a full website URL, and prepend our `baseUrl` from the config file.

Okay, let's save the file and try running the test.

### Running Through Chrome DevTools

Since the Chrome Devtools protocol only requires a supported browser to be installed, if you have a browser like that already installed, you don't need to do anything else. Do check that if you selected `chromedriver` from the `services` list during the `wdio config` section, you go to your `wdio.conf.js` file and comment out the `services` line (this was chromedriver won't start up when running your test).

Now, to run the tests, we call the testrunner in our terminal:

```sh
npx wdio
```

The test will run, you should see a browser pop-up, and successful test output that looks something like:

![Terminal output running our test via Chrome DevTools protocol](images/AE340D40E83E7C1D84D07A0034DE5819.jpg)

Again, notice the line `INFO webdriverio: Initiate new session using the devtools protocol`. That let's us know we really are using the DevTools protocol.

### Running via Selenium Standalone

Assuming you selected the Selenium Standalone service during our config run-through (and have it enabled in your `services` section in your `wdio.conf.js` file, `services: ['selenium-standalone']`), we don't have to do anything to run our tests through Selenium Standalone. This is because the service takes care of starting and stopping our Selenium for us.

The one thing we should check on is making sure the Selenium server we started up earlier isn't still running. Check your terminal windows to make sure this isn't the case (remember you can stop the server by sending the `ctrl-c` key command).

You can also go to `http://localhost:4444/wd/hub` and make sure it returns a "site can't be reached" error. 

Okay, with that out of the way, let's run our tests by calling the WDIO testrunner inside our terminal: 

```sh
npx wdio
```

Like before, after a few moments, test output will start appearing. You'll probably see a browser window pop up. Just let it sit there and do it's thing (this can make for a neat magic trick for someone unfamiliar with automation).

The test will take a few seconds to run, then shut everything down. Once finished, it'll print out the final results, something like:

![Terminal output running our test via Selenium Standalone](images/39A9220512B697E18CB4AE724B3A8C08.jpg)

And remember, our `selenium-standalone` service took care of shutting down the server it started, so we don't have to do anything. 

If you want to try this out, but didn't select the `selenium-standalone` service during the config steps, you can manually install the package by running:

```sh
npm install @wdio/selenium-standalone-service
```

Then add it to your `services` array and give it a shot. 

### Running with ChromeDriver

ChromeDriver also comes with its own WebdriverIO service, allowing us to automatically start and stop a `chromedriver` server during our test run. 

If you didn't select `chromedriver` from the `services` list during the config, installation and usage is much like `selenium-standalone`, beginning with our NPM install step.

You'll need to install two packages:

```sh
npm install wdio-chromedriver-service chromedriver
```

Even though, in an earlier example, we installed the `chromedriver` package globally, we're installing it locally so that it's added to our package.json file. 

Information on the packages we install locally automatically get saved to a `dependency` section of our package.json file by NPM. This gives us the ability to re-install any missing dependencies later on by running `npm install`. This is helpful if you want to load your project from scratch.

With the installation done, we need to do two more things. Jump back into your `wdio.conf.js` file and skip down to the services section. Ensure that the only service defined is `chromedriver` (e.g., `services: ['chromedriver']`)

As I've mentioned before, you don't want to have both `selenium-standalone` and `chromedriver` in your services at the same time as they would conflict with each other.

With that done, let's talk about one more thing. You may recall during our first time using ChromeDriver that we had to update the `port` and `path` settings in our WebDriver session initialization. Well, to help us out, the ChromeDriver service configures this for us. Before you'd need to set this manually in your config, but now it's all handled in the service.

With that all set up, let's run our tests again with our `wdio` command:

```sh
npx wdio
```

The output should look almost identical to before:

![Terminal output running our test via ChromeDriver](images/295EF6EFD41A012957D8763159977669.jpg)

Notice the line `INFO webdriver: [POST] http://localhost:9515/session`. See how the port is set to `9515`? That's the ChromeDriver service managing it all for us!

Whether you use ChromeDriver or Selenium Standalone is entirely up to you. The benefit of ChromeDriver is that you don't need to have Java installed to run, but the drawback is that you can only run your tests in Chrome. 

On the other hand, Selenium Standalone installs and manages all the browser drivers for you, so you're free to run most any browser installed on your computer.

Personally I use either of them depending on the situation. I usually lean on ChromeDriver when starting out, as it's usually quicker to run, then switch to Selenium Standalone when I need to expand my browser coverage.

For the rest of the book, we'll be using ChromeDriver going forward. 

Now that we've got our test running, let's take some time to review the actual code.

### Reviewing the Example Test Code

Just for a quick comparison, below is the sample code for standalone mode versus running through the test runner:

**Standalone:**

{title="test.js"}
```js
const { remote } = require('webdriverio');

(async () => {
    const browser = await remote({
        capabilities: {
            browserName: 'chrome'
        }
    });

    await browser.url('https://webdriver.io');

    const title = await browser.getTitle();
    console.log('Title was: ' + title);

    await browser.deleteSession();
})().catch((e) => console.error(e));
```

**Test Runner:**

{title="test/specs/example.js"}
```js
describe('webdriver.io page', () => {
    it('should have the right title', () => {
        browser.url('https://webdriver.io');
        expect(browser).toHaveTitle(
            'WebdriverIO · Next-gen browser and mobile automation test \
framework for Node.js'
        );
    });
});
```

Overall our test runner code is much more succinct. This is due to quite a few things:

* **No need for `remote` and setting up our `browser` object**: This is all done via the configuration file and test runner
* **No need for `async` and `await` keywords**: By running our tests in `sync` mode, we no longer need to add all that extra code.
* **No need to delete the session**: The test runner manages both creating and ending the sessions, so we don't manually have to do this.

Those are all the things that have been removed, but there are a couple new bits added as well.

There are these `describe` and `it` function calls. They are part of the Mocha framework, and help organize our tests into individual test cases. This is helpful for overall readability, plus we can use them to run or exclude certain cases from our test runs.

- `describe` is used to group sets of tests by the feature they are testing.
- `it` defines a specific test to run.
 
There are usually multiple `it` functions nested inside each `describe`, and sometimes `describe` functions are nested inside each other for a better defined test hierarchy. 

As you can see in our file, `describe` is called as a function, passing in two parameters.

```js
describe('name of test section', function () { });
```

The first parameter is a name for the feature we are testing, in this case `'name of test section'`. The second half of our `describe` call is a function which contains all of the code we want to associate with this feature. 

Inside this function we'll be adding the `it` call. Similar to `describe`, `it` is a function call that takes two parameters:

```js
it('name of individual test', function () { });
```

- The first parameter is the name we give our test, in this case `'name of individual test'`. I like to begin my test case names with `should`, so that it reads `it('should do whatever'...`
- The second parameter is a function which contains our browser commands and assertions.

To bring it all together, here's an example test file with just the structure in place:

```js
describe('Login Page', function () {
    it('should allow you to log in using valid credentials', function () {
        // valid login code here
    });
    it('should not allow you to log in using invalid credentials', function () {
        // invalid login code here
    });
});
```
